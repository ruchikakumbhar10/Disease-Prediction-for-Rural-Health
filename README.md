# 🌿 Early Disease Prediction System | Rural Tech Initiative Project

This project was developed as part of the **Rural Tech Initiative**, focusing on improving early healthcare access in rural areas through technology. Our goal was to create a **disease prediction system** that identifies potential diseases based on symptoms and enhances health awareness through data-driven insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Early Disease Prediction System** predicts possible diseases from user-provided symptoms.  
It aims to empower rural populations with early medical insights, allowing faster consultation and treatment decisions.

The project also includes a **Global Health Statistics Dashboard** that visualizes health trends, prevalence rates, and recovery statistics worldwide to support data-based health policy decisions.

## 💡 Features
- 🌾 **Rural-Focused Problem Statement:** Designed for early disease detection in low-access areas.  
- 🩺 **Symptom-Based Prediction System:** Suggests possible diseases based on entered symptoms.  
- 💻 **Interactive Frontend:** Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for a responsive interface.  
- 📊 **Global Health Dashboard:** Built to visualize key metrics like prevalence, mortality, and recovery rates.  
- 🗣️ **Feedback System:** Collected user feedback to improve prediction reliability and interface usability.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
| Component | Technologies Used |
|------------|------------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Dashboard** | Power BI / Excel-based Global Health Visualization |
| **Documentation & Reporting** | Research Report, Feedback Analysis |
| **Team Collaboration** | Brainstorming, survey design, and system development |

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
The **Global Health Statistics Dashboard** provides:
- Country-wise disease prevalence and mortality rates  
- Treatment access and healthcare availability metrics  
- Recovery rate comparisons and trends over 5 years  
- Visual correlation between income level and health improvement  

---

## 📋 How It Works
1. The user enters symptoms into the system interface.  
2. The model or rule-based logic predicts potential diseases.  
3. The result is displayed with possible preventive measures or recommendations.  
4. User feedback is collected for continuous improvement.  
5. The dashboard provides analytical insights into health patterns globally.

---

## 📢 Impact
- Aimed to **bridge healthcare awareness gaps** in rural communities.  
- Promotes **data-driven decision-making** in public health.  
- Encourages early detection and **reduces diagnostic delays**.

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Integrate a machine learning model for more accurate predictions.  
- Add multilingual support for rural accessibility.  
- Include mobile app integration and real-time health data input.
